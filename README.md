# ruby-identicon

This project is part of my studies about FP in Ruby.

It generates an Identicon, such as Github does for just joined users.

You can also check the Elixir implementation [here](https://github.com/mfbmina/identicon).

This was inspired by [Ruby Lambdas](https://github.com/serradura/ruby-lambdas). Thanks @serradura!
